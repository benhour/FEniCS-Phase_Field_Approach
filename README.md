# FEniCS-Phase_Field_Approach
In this project, a theoretical-computational framework is proposed for predicting the failure behavior of two anisotropic brittle materials, namely, single crystal magnesium and boron carbide. Constitutive equations are derived, in both small and large deformations, by using thermodynamics in order to establish a fully coupled and transient twin and crack system. To study the common deformation mechanisms (e.g., twinning and fracture), a monolithically-solved Ginzburgâ€“Landau-based phase-field theory coupled with the mechanical equilibrium equation is implemented in a finite element simulation framework for the following problems: (i) twin evolution in two-dimensional single crystal magnesium and boron carbide under simple shear deformation; (ii) crack-induced twinning for magnesium under pure mode I and mode II loading; and (iii) study of fracture in homogeneous single crystal boron carbide under biaxial compressive loading.
